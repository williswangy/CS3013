 * CS 3013 Project 2
 * Yuan Wang and YuanDa Song
 * ywang19 & ysong5
 * cs3013_syscall2.c
 * Part 2ï¼š
 * we intercepted the syscall cs3013_syscall2. When the interception done, we are able to print the
 * information as the instructions required(parent and child processes by using the cs3013-syscall2).
 * Process:
 * As the instruction required,
 * 1. use processinfo kinfo struct
 * 2. define temporary task_struct var from the instruction : child, sibling, youngestChild, youngerSibling,
 * olderSibling and initialize them with NULL
 * 3. According to the definiation in processimfo, we need to initialize values with -1 withn
 * kinfo.state,pid,parent_pid,youngestChild,youngerSibling,olderSibling,uid as requied
 * 4. initialize time related values with 0 => start_time,user_time,sys_time,cutime,cstime.
 * 5. In order to compare the time difference, we need to first assign the values in kinfo based on the
 * current task: current -> state, pid from the kinfo.state and kinfo pid. current_uid().val for the uid
 * parent_pid needs to assign through current->parent->pid
 * 6. Then we will use the strcuct list_for_each_entry(pos, head, member) to iterate over the list of given
 * types.
 * 7. For each childprocess from the current, we need to add up the user and system time
 * 8. For the siblingprocess, we need to get the youngerSibling and olderSibling
 * 9. As the instruction mentioned, we need use the fucntion timespec_compare() by comparing the starttime and
 * endtime among the task_struct variables.
 * When we finished the comparing, we need to set the youngestChild, youngerSibling and olderSibling based 
 * the result list from the above part
 * 10. Assign the values to the process time
 * 11. As the instruction required, copy struct to userspace safely.
